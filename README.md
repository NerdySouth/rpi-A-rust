## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Nox is a playground for OS concepts and design in Rust. Initially, we are starting with the Rpi Zero/A+ platform which is a 32bit armv6 platform. The idea is to build a fast, safe OS for doing cool things on a pi. A lot of the initial features will likely come from the work done by Dawson Engler for CS140E at Stanford. I took this class as an undergrad, and want to expand on what we worked on there and push it further with Rust.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Testing coming soon!

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
